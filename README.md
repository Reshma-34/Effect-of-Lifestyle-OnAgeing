Various studies have shown discrepancies in ageing even in genetically identical people. It has been reported that major factors of discordance are personal lifestyle choices and habits such as smoking, alcohol etc. By understanding lifestyle and prior medical history, we have created predictive disease model.

The main motive behind such models is to develop health protocols as well as customized medical treatments to prevent benign symptoms from becoming more severe.
